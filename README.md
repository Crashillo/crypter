# Crypter

The Crypter project contains a compiled C# library, its source code and a simple GUI. This tool is a user-friendly interface about what *MD5Encryption.dll* does. The library uses a private pattern to convert a string to an md5-string. It applies the md5 algorithm to encrypt/decrypt any text through this private pattern. UI available in German, English and Spanish.
